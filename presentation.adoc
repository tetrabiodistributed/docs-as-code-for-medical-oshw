== What is Open Source Medical/PPE Hardware?

[%step]
- Medical Devices or Personal Protective Equipment (PPE's) developed as Open Source Hardware (OSHW)

=== What is Open Source Hardware?

[%step]
- OSHW is hardware developed/published like Open Source Software (OSS)

 (source: OSHWA definition for OSHW)

- License (s.a, CERN Open Hardware License) allows for modificatoin/redistribution of hardware design 

 (source: OSHWA definition for OSHW)

- Documentation & design tools themselves should be open-source

 (source: OSI definition for OSS)

== What is Docs-as-Code?

[%step]
_The philosophy/practice that documentation should be maintained using the same tools & approach as code_

== Why develop Medical Devices/PPE's as OSHW (using a Docs-as-Code approach)?

[%step]
- Distributed manufacturing
 useful when faced by supplychain vulnerabilities, s.a., in the event of a global pandemic
- Quality product
 By leveraging talent of the open-source hardware developer community

Distributed manufacturing - useful when faced by supplychain vulnerabilities, s.a., in the event of a global pandemic
Open source can yield a better product by virtue of subjecting it to more eyes;
"Given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow" - Linus' Law
--

== Why use a Docs-as-Code approach?

[%step]
- Works with modern version control systems (s.a., git)
- Allows for parallel development
- Reviewing documentation is like a code review
- Content can be open-sourced, allowing anyone to contribute
- Doctools can be leveraged to produce stakeholder-specific documentation

 s.a., for quality management, /auditability

Works with modern version control systems (s.a., git)
Using a distributed version control tool means docs & design files can be released together, as to not go out ouf sync
Using a distributed version control tool also allows for parallel development
Reviewing documentation is like a code review
Content can be open-sourced, allowing anyone to contribute
Doctools can be leveraged to produce stakeholder-specific documentation
a model-based approach to documentation can be leveraged to allow for machine-queryable documentation; which would enable stakeholder-specific views, s.a., documentation for regulatory audits

[.notes]
--
Regulatory bodies s.a., the FDA requires documented processes demonstrating manufactured medical devices are safe & effective
as well as traceable audit trail of the design processes
- which can be satisfied, using a docs-as-code approach, via doctools, linters, distributed version control system, & code review practices used in software development

== How to adopt a Docs-as-Code approach

[%step]
- Language
- Toolchain
- Methodology

=== Language

Consider the following...

[%step]
- Markup Language

 s.a., Markdown, RestructuredText, LaTeX, Asciidoc

- Template Language

 s.a., Liquid, Jinja2, Handlebars

- Modeling Language

 s.a., OML, SysML v2

=== Toolchain

[%step]
- Text Editor / IDE

 s.a., vim, nano, VS code

- Version Control System

 s.a., git, svn, mercurial

- Static Site Generator / Rendering Engine

 s.a., Sphinx, Asciidoctor, Hugo

- Issue Tracker

 s.a., Jira, GitHub, GitLab

- Publishing Platform

 s.a., GitHub Pages, ReadTheDocs, Netlify

- Automation Pipeline

 s.a., GitHub Actions, Jenkins

=== Methodology

[%step]
- Workflow

 s.a., Docs-Driven-Development: Write your docs first, then implement what you documented

- Contributing guidelines

 s.a., style guide, code of conduct

- Agile Development Practice

 e.g., scrum, kanban

- Code (Docs) Review Process

 Have someone review your docs (e.g., as a pull request on GitHub)

== Community Resources

=== Write The Docs

--
image::https://www.writethedocs.org/_static/sticker-wtd-colors.png[WTD, 200, 200]
_A community for technical writers & documentarians_
https://www.writethedocs.org/
--

[.notes]
--
WTD is A community for technical writers & documentarians;
You can join their online slack group;
they also have a podcast (so if you're stuck in LA traffic and looking for a new podcast; there you go)

[.notes]
--
OSHWA is the organization that certifies OSHW projects;
They also have a discord channel
& (as of recently) an open-standards working group

oshw-standards project is led by the OSHWA working group to develop open standards s.a., for configuration management & quality management of OSHW for industries s.a., Medical & Aerospace
DOF is a framework for distributed open-source hardware; think NodeJS/NPM's package management for distributed OSHW
QMS-CLI is a tool being developed by Tetra for generating/managing documentation for quality management of medical OSHW
PAPRa is kind of Tetra's flagship OSHW respirator project that is published using a docs-as-code approach
This presentation is also published using a docs-as-code approach (so, if you'd like to contribute to improving this very presentation, open an issue!)
