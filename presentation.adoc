= Docs-as-Code for Open-Source Medical Hardware & PPE's

// JRS - recommend including a reference to DaC early on (like https://www.writethedocs.org/guide/docs-as-code/) for the uninitiated
// JRS - I think the slides could use more visuals (images, charts, tables, etc) to break up the text and provide evidence in support of your claims

by Sean Marquez

== Context

[%step]
Case spikes throughout the COVID-19 pandemic have caused shortages across the medical supplychain

== Call to Action

[%step]
Build open-source medical hardware to supplement shortage!

// JRS - suggest adding a sub-list here of why OSHW is the solution (the rest of the talk depends on the audience agreeing with this principle)
// JRS - this can then lead naturally to the next slide ("If OSHW is so great, why aren't we all just doing this already?  What is blocking us?")

== Roadblocks

[%step]
- Regulatory environment
- How to build open-source hardware (OSHW)

=== 21 CFR Part 820 subparts

// JRS - nothing after subpart I renders on my machine
// JRS - it is probably worth it to put extra emphasis on parts C, D, F, G, and M since they all touch docs in one way or another

[%step]
- Subpart B—Quality System Requirements
- Subpart C—Design Controls
- Subpart D—Document Controls
- Subpart E—Purchasing Controls
- Subpart F—Identification and Traceability
- Subpart G—Production and Process Controls
- Subpart H—Acceptance Activities
- Subpart I—Nonconforming Product
- Subpart J—Corrective and Preventive Action (CAPA)
- Subpart K—Labeling and Packaging Control
- Subpart L—Handling, Storage, Distribution, and Installation
- Subpart M—Records
- Subpart N—Servicing
- Subpart O—Statistical Techniques

=== TL;DR

"Manufacturers of medical devices shall ensure that finished devices will be safe and effective."

// JRS - recommend including an additonal phrase here about this takes developing and maintaining high quality documentation

== How-to build Open-Source Hardware (OSHW)

=== OSHW Definition

[%step]
- OSHW s/b like OSSW;
  license & design should allow for anyone to make, modify, and/or redistribute the hardware

 (source: OSHWA)

- Documentation & design tools themselves should be accessible and open-source

 (source: OSHWA)

== Realization

// JRS - I don't think I would label this a realization, at least not without earlier slides covering the search for options (and coming up empty handed)
// JRS - This is more of a refinement of Roadblock 2

[%step]
Tools for documenting open-source hardware are virtually non-existent

== Meet _Write The Docs_

[%step]
_A community for technical writers & documentarians_

// JRS - here is a good place for an image, screenshot of the Write the Docs website

== Docs-as-Code

[%step]
_The philosophy that documentation should be maintained using the same tools & approach as code_

// JRS - this is what I was referring to early on in the presentation; this quote should be much earlier so the audience understands what you are calling for from the beginning

== Docs-as-Code Advantages

// JRS - tightened title 

[%step]
- Works with distributed version control systems (s.a., git)  // JRS - did you mean e.g. here?
- Allows for parallel development
- Reviewing documentation is like a code review
- Documentation itself can be open-sourced, allowing anyone to contribute

[.notes]
--
- satisfies traceability requirements
- GH code reviews for documentation satisfies Q/A
- "Given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow" - Linus' Law

// JRS - love this slide

== How to adopt a Docs-as-Code approach

[%step]
- Language
- Toolchain
- Methodology

=== Language

[%step]
- Markup Language
- Template Language
- Modeling Language

=== Toolchain

[%step]
- Text Editor
- Version Control System
- Static Site Generator / Rendering Engine
- Automation Pipeline

=== Methodology

// JRS - Suggest including definition of a methodology here (see https://github.com/Mach30/dof#introduction)
// JRS - Suggest emphasizing systematic approach, independent of tools, and that ensures the "source" in OSHW is shared in a compatible manner across teams/projects/components

[%step]
- Workflow
- Contributing guidelines (s.a., style guide)
- Documentation review process

== Examples

<PAPRa docs screenshot>

== In-Development

Adopting a framework for OSHW,
untethered from vendor lock-in or content management systems (CMS),
that allows for the generation of

- Bill of Materials (BOM)
- Purchase Orders (PO)
- Assembly instructions
- Design Documentation

s.a., the Distributed OSHW Framework (DOF)

== Let's go build open-source hardware!

// JRS - I would add a tag line at the end like "Especially Medical Hardware & PPE's"
